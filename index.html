                    Our goal is to bridge the gender gap in the field of technology by empowering girls. We aspire to do so by engaging in a plethora of
                    activities that educate, challenge and inspire young girls.
                    Today, only 25% of computing workforce are women and we hope to balance it in the near future. We want to launch an effort that
                    connects young girls with women leaders of the community to guide them.</p>
